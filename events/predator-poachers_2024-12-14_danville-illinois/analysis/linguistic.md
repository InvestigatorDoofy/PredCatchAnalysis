   - Self-exonerating: "I'm trying to think because, honestly, I don't remember." (362-368)

3. Comparative features:

   - Interviewer communication: 3.8x more hedging language, 5.2x more fillers
   - Emotional expressions absent in interviewer communication but present in decoy reporting

---

This linguistic analysis reveals significant patterns in the subject's communication strategies throughout the interview. The most notable findings include:

1. Extensive hedging language increasing in frequency as the interview progresses
2. Dramatic shifts in sentence complexity during critical admission points
3. Systematic differences in language when discussing self versus others
4. Distinct speech pattern disruptions (fillers, fragmentation) correlating with deception indicators
5. Differential language usage when reporting communication with the decoy versus engaging with the interviewer

These linguistic features collectively demonstrate strategic language deployment to minimize culpability while making unavoidable admissions, with marked deterioration of linguistic coherence during high-stress admission sequences.
