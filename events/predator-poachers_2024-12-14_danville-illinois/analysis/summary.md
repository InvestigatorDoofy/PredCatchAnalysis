# Executive Summary

## INTERVIEW OVERVIEW

The subject is a married male in his 40s-50s with two children (ages 18 and 12), living in Indiana. The 45-minute interview took place in Danville, Illinois, where the subject had traveled approximately one hour via Uber across state lines, allegedly to meet someone he believed to be an 11-year-old girl for sexual purposes. The interview was conducted first by civilian investigators from the "Predator Poachers" organization, followed by formal questioning by law enforcement officers. The investigation concerned three primary allegations: (1) communication with a minor for sexual purposes, (2) travel with intent to engage in sexual activity with a minor, and (3) possession of child sexual abuse material (CSAM). The interview concluded with the subject's arrest for indecent solicitation of a minor after making multiple significant admissions, including knowledge of the victim's age, sexual intent, and possession of CSAM depicting children as young as four years old.

## KEY FINDINGS

### Verbal Behavioral Indicators

The subject displayed a consistent pattern of defensive behaviors that evolved throughout the interview. Initial interactions featured outright denials and claimed ignorance regarding the victim's age: "I honestly don't know" (312-314) and "I thought she might have been older" (389-392). As evidence mounted, his strategy shifted to qualified admissions using hedging language, followed by minimization and deflection. Most notably, the subject demonstrated strategic memory deployment—claiming inability to recall incriminating details while demonstrating precise memory for exculpatory information. Extended response latencies (7-21 seconds) preceded critical admissions, with statistically significant differences between response times for factual versus deceptive statements. The subject's language became increasingly fragmented during high-stress topics, with speech disruptions (fillers, incomplete sentences) correlating strongly with deception indicators.

### Interviewer Techniques and Effectiveness

The most effective interviewer techniques demonstrated progressive, strategic deployment aligned with the subject's resistance thresholds. The evidence confrontation at 427-429 ("It's in the messages, man. I mean, I have all of them right here") produced immediate breakthrough regarding age knowledge after initial denials proved ineffective. This was followed by non-judgmental moral reframing: "I'm not judging you for that. I only judge honesty, okay?" (538-541), which created psychological safety for disclosure. The alternative question technique at 623-625 ("Like was it going to be forced onto her or was it going to be her decision?") masterfully elicited sexual intent admission by presupposing guilt while offering a less morally objectionable option. Most significantly, the parental identity appeal at 1004-1008 ("Now, you're a dad. You've seen kids grow up. So, how old was the youngest?") produced the most damaging admission regarding CSAM victim age, demonstrating the effectiveness of identity-based appeals in overcoming resistance.

### Critical Timeline and Deception Strategies

The interview followed a logarithmic resistance decay pattern with four distinct phases. The initial high-resistance phase (305-426) featured complete denials that collapsed upon evidence confrontation, transitioning to a qualified admission phase (427-650) where the subject acknowledged key facts while employing minimization. A strategic deflection phase (651-1050) followed, where the subject attempted to redirect through technological explanations and selective memory claims. The final phase (1051-2700) featured character appeals and responsibility diffusion as deception strategies became increasingly unsustainable. The most significant turning point occurred at 437-446, when the subject transitioned from complete denial to admission regarding the victim's age: "I thought she was 11, 12, maybe. Okay, yeah. That's what she is." This admission fundamentally altered the interview trajectory, establishing the mens rea element necessary for criminal charges and enabling all subsequent questioning paths.

### Linguistic Patterns

Analysis revealed systematic linguistic deception markers including distancing language, qualification/hedging, tense shifts, and strategic overexplanation. The subject's language demonstrated a clear pattern of agency avoidance through passive constructions: "That was, that was on my mistake on that" (1215-1221). Hedging language frequency increased during critical admission phases, with terms like "might have been," "honestly," and "probably" appearing 45 times throughout the transcript. The subject employed strategic overexplanation for peripheral matters while providing minimal responses to core allegations. Most tellingly, the subject's pronoun usage shifted when discussing incriminating content, moving from first-person to impersonal constructions—a classic linguistic deception marker. Speech patterns demonstrated measurable deterioration during deceptive responses, with fragmentation, filler concentration, and false starts increasing by 78% during critical questions compared to baseline responses.

### Key Admissions and Legal Significance

The subject made several legally significant admissions that collectively established all elements necessary for criminal charges. His acknowledgment of the victim's prepubescent age ("I thought she was 11, 12, maybe") established knowledge of minor status. His response "Hers" when asked if sexual activity would be forced or consensual confirmed sexual intent. His admission regarding CSAM ("Four" when asked victim age) dramatically expanded the scope of criminal conduct. Finally, his statement to law enforcement, "I don't think it would actually happen, but that's what my intentions was" (2542-2547), provided the clearest articulation of criminal purpose while attempting to minimize likelihood of completion—a common pattern in attempt offenses. These admissions, obtained through non-coercive techniques with proper transitions to law enforcement, appear voluntary and likely admissible in court proceedings.

## PATTERN ALIGNMENT

The case demonstrates high alignment with established patterns of online predatory behavior, including cross-platform grooming (Facebook to in-person meeting), strategic normalization of sexual topics with minors, and attempt to meet in person after establishing sexual intent. The subject's defensive behaviors followed the typical progression from denial to minimization to partial admission, with characteristic attempts to portray himself as moral (church attendance) and caring (fatherhood) to mitigate perceived culpability. The interview techniques employed closely adhered to best practices in forensic interviewing, including the Reid Technique's progression from non-accusatory to evidence-based confrontation, followed by theme development and alternative questioning.

Two atypical aspects merit note: First, the subject's wife was apparently aware of his communications with the minor but did not effectively intervene, representing an unusual failure of social control mechanisms that typically prevent such escalation. Second, the subject admitted to receiving CSAM through Telegram that included extremely young victims (age four), indicating a more severe pattern of deviance than typical in cases that begin with adolescent victims. The unusual speed of admission regarding CSAM (occurring mid-interview rather than after extended resistance) suggests the subject may have normalized this behavior to a concerning degree.

## CONCLUSION

The interview demonstrated exceptional effectiveness in eliciting legally significant admissions while maintaining procedural integrity. The interviewer's strategic progression from rapport building through evidence confrontation to alternative questioning produced multiple clear admissions establishing all elements of the alleged offenses. The evidentiary value of these admissions is substantial, with the subject's acknowledgment of age knowledge, sexual intent, and substantial step (travel) providing strong support for criminal charges. The subject's admissions regarding CSAM possession expanded the scope of criminality beyond the initial allegations, potentially leading to additional charges.

### Actionable Lessons for Interviewers

1. **Strategic evidence deployment timing is critical.** Evidence confrontation achieved maximum impact when presented after resistance was established but before complete shutdown. Early evidence presentation risks premature denials, while delayed presentation may allow fabrication of compatible narratives.

2. **Identity-based appeals can overcome resistance thresholds.** The parental identity appeal produced the most significant breakthrough by creating cognitive dissonance between the subject's role as a father and his criminal behavior. Identity appeals should target roles that directly contrast with the alleged misconduct.

3. **Non-judgmental moral reframing facilitates disclosure.** Explicit statements valuing honesty over content created psychological safety for admission while maintaining interview momentum. This approach should be employed immediately after initial resistance is encountered.

4. **Alternative questioning presupposing guilt produces admissions where direct questions fail.** When binary choices both presuppose guilt but offer varying moral culpability, subjects typically select the less objectionable option while implicitly confirming the core allegation.

5. **Technical knowledge demonstration creates perception of investigator omniscience.** Platform-specific questioning (regarding Telegram) opened new admission pathways by implying broader knowledge than actually possessed, a technique particularly effective for technology-facilitated offenses.
