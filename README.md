# 🔍 PredCatchAnalysis

A data repository and analytical framework based on predator catcher interviews, focusing on behavioral analysis, interviewer techniques, and statistical patterns.

> ⚠️ **DEVELOPMENT STATUS** ⚠️  
> This repository is currently in early development stages. Data structures, analysis methods, and documentation are actively evolving.

## Project Overview

This repository contains structured data from predator catching interviews, including:
- Text data from interview conversations
- Behavioral analysis of subject responses
- Interviewer technique assessment
- Statistical data on patterns across multiple interviews

The project aims to identify effective interview techniques, common deception patterns, and provide evidence-based insights for law enforcement, researchers, decoys and predator catching teams.

## Interview Data Format

Interview data is stored in a structured JSON format following a defined schema. The schema is available in the repository at [`schemas/transcription.schema.json`](schemas/transcription.schema.json).

### Key Data Points

| Level | Data Point | Description |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| **Document** | `language` | Primary language of the interview |
| | `num_speakers` | Number of distinct speakers |
| **Segment** | `speaker` | Speaker identifier (e.g., "interviewer", "subject") |
| | `start`/`end` | Timestamp in seconds |
| | `text` | Transcribed speech segment |
| | `duration` | Length of speech segment in seconds |
| **Word** | `word` | Individual transcribed word |
| | `start`/`end` | Precise timestamp for each word |
| | `probability` | Confidence score for word accuracy |

### Sample Visualization

```
[00:01:23] Interviewer: "Did she tell you she was 11?"
[00:01:28] Subject:     "I don't remember."
           ^^^^^^^^^    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
           Speaker      Text content
```

This granular structure allows for detailed analysis of response timing, speech patterns, and confidence metrics across interviews.

## Analysis Framework

Analysis is conducted across multiple dimensions:

### Behavioral Analysis
- Deception indicators
- Minimization techniques
- Admission patterns
- Self-contradiction tracking
- Evasion strategies

### Interviewer Techniques
- Rapport building effectiveness
- Question sequencing
- Evidence presentation strategy
- Pressure application methods
- Confession elicitation success rates

### Statistical Patterns
- Common excuses and rationalizations
- Platform frequency analysis
- Demographic correlations
- Technique effectiveness metrics
- Temporal patterns in admissions

## Usage

This repository is intended for:
- Researchers studying predatory behavior
- Law enforcement training
